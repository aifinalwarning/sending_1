# America's planetary capacity crisis: ten bottlenecks threatening security and survival

The United States is simultaneously dismantling the institutional infrastructure required to address existential-scale threats—climate destabilization, pandemic risk, nuclear proliferation, AI misalignment, and orbital debris—while those threats accelerate. **Between January 2025 and February 2026, approximately 352,000 federal employees exited their roles (9% of the federal workforce), including 10,109 doctoral-level STEM experts**, gutting the agencies responsible for planetary benevolence and security. This is the largest peacetime workforce reduction in US history, occurring precisely as GAO identifies workforce capacity gaps as the root cause of 20 of its 38 high-risk areas. The consequences are not abstract: FEMA entered the 2025 hurricane season with only **12% of its incident management workforce available** (a five-year low); CDC suffered a 24% staff reduction while measles cases hit their worst level in 30 years; and the US AI Safety Institute was effectively dismantled while frontier AI capabilities advanced at unprecedented speed.

What follows is a systematic analysis of the ten most critical bottlenecks preventing US federal agencies and major institutions from achieving planetary-scale goals, with specific intervention points for policymakers and institutional leaders.

## 1. Interagency coordination has collapsed under structural fragmentation and leadership vacuums

Federal disaster assistance is now **fragmented across more than 30 entities** with no reform commission established, according to GAO's 2025 High Risk List (GAO-25-107743). This fragmentation has become lethal. FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program—the primary pre-disaster resilience grant bridging EPA environmental monitoring, USDA agricultural resilience, and FEMA disaster preparedness—was fully terminated. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), designed to coordinate biodefense across health, defense, and homeland security, was dismantled and subsumed under CDC, severing established interagency coordination mechanisms for medical countermeasures.

The AI safety coordination gap is particularly acute. The US AI Safety Institute at NIST—specifically designed to coordinate AI evaluations with DOD, DOE, DHS, OSTP, and the Intelligence Community—was gutted through 497 layoffs and renamed the "Center for AI Standards and Innovation." Its mission was transformed from safety evaluation to standards-setting and "damage detection." No equivalent civilian coordinating body for cross-agency AI safety exists.

In space, six agencies share authority over orbital traffic (NASA, DOD/Space Force, FCC, FAA, Commerce Department, State Department) with no unified civil space traffic management authority. The National Space Council was revoked by Executive Order 14369 (December 18, 2025) and replaced by OSTP coordination—an office with limited convening authority and a technology-focused director whose background is in venture capital, not multi-agency science coordination.

**Intervention points:** Establish a statutory interagency coordination body for planetary security threats modeled on the National Security Council. Reconstitute the National Space Council or equivalent with binding authority. Implement GAO's eight leading collaboration practices across all agencies handling overlapping planetary missions. Create a dedicated "Planetary Security Directorate" within the NSC structure.

## 2. Permitting timelines are incompatible with planetary urgency across every sector

The average time from mineral discovery to mine production in the United States is **29 years**—second longest globally. Transmission lines take **over 10 years** to site, permit, and build, while DOE estimates transmission mileage must increase 60% by 2030 and triple by mid-century. Only 320 miles of new high-voltage transmission were completed in 2024, one of the lowest figures since 2011. Nuclear reactor licensing historically takes approximately seven years, though Executive Order 14300 (May 2025) sets an aspirational 18-month target.

The Trump administration's NEPA overhaul creates a paradoxical situation. CEQ rescinded government-wide NEPA regulations (effective April 2025), directing each agency to craft its own—introducing near-term chaos even as it targets long-term acceleration. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, signed July 4, 2025) allows project sponsors to pay fees for halved review timelines (EIS from 2 years to 1 year), but the transition period has introduced what Morgan Lewis characterizes as "notable uncertainty" from the absence of consistent guidance combined with pending litigation.

Biosecurity permitting faces its own crisis. Executive Order 14292 (May 5, 2025) rescinded the 2024 DURC/PEPP policy on the day it went into effect, halted all federally funded gain-of-function research, and charged OSTP with issuing a replacement within 120 days. **As of late 2025, no replacement framework has been published**, creating what the journal *mSphere* calls a "biosecurity policy vacuum." Meanwhile, benchtop DNA/RNA synthesis devices remain largely unregulated despite rising biosecurity risks, and AI tools can now engineer novel toxins that evade existing synthesis screening protocols.

**Intervention points:** Create a centralized federal mining office (as in Canada/Australia) to reduce coordination failures. Grant FERC binding backstop siting authority for interstate transmission lines. Prioritize exploration-phase permitting reform as the highest-impact intervention for mineral supply chains. Immediately publish replacement DURC/PEPP biosecurity framework. Pass the Biosecurity Modernization and Innovation Act to mandate DNA synthesis screening.

## 3. Climate and health data infrastructure is being systematically dismantled

The federal open science architecture is under direct assault. NOAA's Climate.gov was taken offline June 24, 2025. The National Climate Assessment website went dark July 1, 2025, and all 400 experts working on the Sixth National Climate Assessment were dismissed. NOAA's Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database ceased updates. EPA removed its Greenhouse Gas Inventory data, forcing the Environmental Defense Fund to FOIA and republish it. EPA's EJScreen and the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool were taken offline.

Most consequentially, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) terminated public data distribution on July 31, 2025, citing "cybersecurity concerns." **DMSP provides approximately 50% of high-quality microwave satellite scans used for hurricane forecasting.** DOD retained access while cutting off NOAA and civilian forecasters during an active hurricane season—an action meteorologists called "insanity."

Health data sharing remains crippled by legacy infrastructure: **81% of hospitals reported at least one challenge to electronic public health reporting in 2024**, averaging three out of seven challenge categories. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed antiquated systems—some public health departments were still using fax machines—yet CDC's data modernization efforts were undercut by a 24% workforce reduction. The entire MMWR (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report) staff was fired in October 2025, disrupting the primary vehicle for public health data communication for the first time in over a century.

The Nelson Memo's open-access mandate (requiring all agencies to update public access policies by December 31, 2025) faces uncertain survival—the press release linking to it now returns a 404 error on the White House website. However, NIH expedited its public access policy effective July 1, 2025, creating an inconsistent landscape.

**Intervention points:** Codify open science mandates in statute (expanding the OPEN Government Data Act) to insulate them from executive revocation. Restore DMSP public data sharing immediately. Fund civil society data rescue operations (Environmental Data & Governance Initiative model). Accelerate TEFCA and electronic case reporting adoption to close the 81% hospital challenge rate. Preserve and expand wastewater surveillance (NWSS) permanent appropriations.

## 4. Funding fragmentation makes long-term planetary investment structurally impossible

The Department of Defense has operated under a continuing resolution in **45 of the last 49 fiscal years**. Under CRs, agencies cannot start new programs, grow existing ones, or hire staff—they can only slow existing work. The FY2025 full-year CR froze spending at FY2024 levels, cutting DOD's Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs by 57% and zeroing out the only federal program dedicated to pancreatic cancer research. GAO found that 36 of 74 DOD acquisition programs reported schedule effects from CRs, with F-35 program officials estimating 20% of their time is spent replanning.

The Inflation Reduction Act rollback compounds the damage. The OBBBA repealed the residential clean energy credit, terminated EV credits after September 30, 2025, and accelerated wind/solar phase-outs. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates **$77.4 billion in revenue from credit repeals through FY2034**. Johns Hopkins Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab estimates up to $80 billion in battery/solar supply-chain investment could be diverted abroad. The Rhodium Group projects a 57-62% reduction in clean energy capacity additions through 2035.

Meanwhile, only **47% of available IIJA funding had been obligated** ($275 billion of $581 billion) as of December 2024—after three-plus years. Only 21% had actually been outlaid. Some funding deadlines arrived as early as September 30, 2025, risking expiration of unused funds. GAO found that 23% of FY2022 discretionary grant awardees still did not have signed grant agreements by early 2025.

Federal climate funding spans 19 agencies, but 94% goes to multi-purpose programs where climate is one of multiple objectives. The coordinating entity—the US Global Change Research Program—was proposed for a 97% cut, with hundreds of scientists dismissed from the 2028 National Climate Assessment. The structural mismatch between one-year appropriations cycles and multi-decade climate timelines (2050 net-zero targets, century-scale ecosystem restoration) remains the deepest systemic barrier.

**Intervention points:** Establish multi-year appropriations authority for climate, biosecurity, and space debris programs, removing them from annual CR vulnerability. Accelerate IIJA obligation before 2026 reauthorization creates additional uncertainty. Replace IRA demand-side signals for critical minerals across defense, semiconductor, and energy sectors. Expand DOD/DOE anomaly authorities for critical clean energy and biosecurity programs under CRs.

## 5. DOGE-driven civil service erosion has created compound vulnerabilities across every planetary security domain

The scale of institutional damage is unprecedented. **EPA lost 33% of its staff** (approximately 5,300 of 16,155), reaching workforce levels not seen since the Nixon/Ford administrations. Its Scientific Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee were disbanded, with no replacements named nine months later. FEMA lost 2,446 employees by June 2025, with half of Senior Executive Service roles vacant, while managing 710 open disasters. The agency's CORE workforce (8,800+ employees, 39% of total) was shifted to 30-day renewable contracts, and an internal December 2025 email envisioned cutting the workforce in half.

Nuclear security suffered a particularly alarming episode. Up to 350 NNSA employees were abruptly fired on February 13-14, 2025, with the Pantex Plant—America's nuclear warhead reassembly facility—absorbing approximately 30% of cuts. **DOGE denied NNSA's national security exemption request because "officials did not seem to know this agency oversees America's nuclear weapons."** Nearly all firings were rescinded within 24 hours, but the institutional damage—lost clearances, broken trust, departed expertise—persisted.

NIH was proposed for a 40% budget cut (from $48 billion to $27 billion), with 5,844 grants and 1,996 NSF grants cancelled or suspended. At least 160 clinical trials were halted. Congress ultimately set NIH's FY2026 budget at $48.7 billion—a near-total rejection of the proposed cuts—but the chilling effect on the research pipeline is already manifest: new project approvals plummeted approximately 50%, and PhD program enrollments in life/biomedical sciences flatlined.

The brain drain extends internationally. A Nature poll found **75% of US researchers are considering leaving the country**. European Research Council applications from US researchers nearly tripled (60 in 2024 to 169 in 2026). The EU announced a €600 million recruitment package. France launched "Choose France for Science" and is pursuing "scientific refugee" immigration status. The talent pipeline that took decades to build is being dismantled in months.

**Intervention points:** Establish statutory floor staffing levels for critical planetary security functions (nuclear safety, disaster response, disease surveillance, weather forecasting). Create fast-track security clearance restoration for recalled employees. Fund international science collaboration agreements insulated from executive order disruption. Pass the Scientific Integrity Act to codify protections against political interference.

## 6. AI governance exists in a vacuum between revoked federal policy and accelerating capability

President Trump revoked Biden's AI Executive Order 14110 on his first day in office (January 20, 2025), eliminating safety testing requirements for dual-use foundation models, reporting requirements for large AI model developers, and the institutional framework for federal AI governance. The replacement—"America's AI Action Plan" (July 2025)—emphasizes "permissionless innovation" and directed the FTC to terminate investigations that "unduly burden AI innovation."

The numbers reveal a staggering asymmetry: the US AI Safety Institute received a maximum of **$10 million for FY2024/2025, while private sector AI investment exceeded $109 billion in 2024 alone**. The Center for AI Policy concluded: "The US has committed to spend far less than peers on AI safety." The 200-organization AISIC consortium formed under Biden has an unclear mandate under the renamed CAISI, and the US refused to sign the February 2025 Paris AI Action Summit communiqué on AI safety.

The federal talent deficit is worsening at the worst possible time. Roughly **19,500 data, technology, and telecom employees left government in 2025**. Biden's AI Talent Surge had hired 250 of a planned 500+ practitioners; these gains were reversed. DARPA acknowledges "no well-developed capability nor broader ecosystem exists to operationally assess currently deployed AI-enabled battlefield systems," despite the Pentagon overseeing 685+ AI-related projects.

States are filling the vacuum—over 1,000 AI-related bills were introduced across states in 2024-2025—but a December 2025 executive order established an AI Litigation Task Force under the Attorney General to challenge state AI laws and condition BEAD broadband funding on state compliance. The result is neither coherent federal regulation nor functional state innovation: a governance void during the most consequential period of AI capability development in history.

**Intervention points:** Give CAISI/AISI statutory authority and independent funding (the Obernolte bill pathway). Establish mandatory federal AI incident reporting. Close the safety funding gap by dedicating at least 1% of federal AI procurement spending to safety evaluation. Ensure the FY2026 NDAA's June 2026 deadline for DOD's cross-functional AI assessment team is met with adequate resources. Either pass coherent federal AI legislation or preserve state regulatory authority—the current approach of preempting states without replacing their frameworks is the worst outcome.

## 7. Critical mineral dependencies create acute vulnerabilities in both green and defense technology

China controls **98% of gallium, 91% of graphite processing, 90% of rare earth refining, 77% of cobalt chemicals, 68% of germanium, and 57% of lithium processing**. The US is fully import-dependent for 12 critical minerals and reliant on imports for more than 50% of an additional 29. Each F-35 contains 920 pounds of rare earth elements. In April 2025, China imposed export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements and explicitly denied licenses to 15 US defense contractors—the first restrictions specifically targeting the defense sector.

The policy response has been substantial but structurally incomplete. The OBBBA appropriated **$8.5 billion for critical minerals and defense supply chains**, including $2 billion for the National Defense Stockpile and $5 billion for the Industrial Base Fund. DOD took a 15% equity stake in MP Materials (the only active US rare earth mine) with a $400 million investment and $110/kg price floor for neodymium-praseodymium oxide. DOE announced approximately $1 billion in funding for battery materials processing and critical mineral recovery.

The critical gap is the **"missing middle"**—midstream processing of cathode, anode, and refined mineral materials. Government and private capital has flowed to mining and cell manufacturing, but the processing segment where China dominates 70-90% remains neglected. The OBBBA simultaneously eliminated the $7,500 EV tax credit (the largest demand-side driver of critical mineral investment) while investing billions on the supply side—a fundamental incoherence that undermines private investment certainty. Between 2022 and 2025, cobalt prices fell 60%, nickel 73%, and lithium 87%, making new domestic projects unviable without guaranteed offtake.

**Intervention points:** Prioritize midstream processing investment, where each dollar yields more supply chain security than equivalent upstream or downstream spending. Expand the MP Materials price floor model to other minerals. Replace the eliminated EV credit demand signal with defense/semiconductor/energy sector purchase commitments. Accelerate the Minerals Security Partnership from framework to execution, focusing on REE processing with Australia/Japan and lithium with South American allies.

## 8. Biosecurity public-private partnerships are unraveling at the worst possible moment

On August 5, 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a "coordinated wind-down" of all BARDA mRNA vaccine development, terminating **22 projects worth approximately $500 million**—including Moderna's $590 million H5N1 avian influenza vaccine contract. This occurred while H5N1 had infected 995+ dairy herds, 168+ million birds, and caused at least 70 human cases across 13 states with the first confirmed US death.

The pharmaceutical industry is retreating. Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel announced the company would not invest in new late-stage vaccine trials. The FDA under the Trump administration refused to accept Moderna's mRNA seasonal flu vaccine application. Smaller biotechs lost contracts en masse: GeoVax ($388M), Codagenix ($389M), CastleVax ($338M), Vaxart ($456M paused). Gritstone ceased operations entirely. The hostile regulatory environment has created what experts call a "destruction of the vaccine market."

The Strategic National Stockpile holds enough H5N1 vaccine for only **5 million people** (two-dose regimen) in a country of 330 million. The mRNA platform—the only technology capable of producing pandemic vaccines at global scale within months—has been defunded precisely as the H5N1 threat escalates. The egg-based vaccine alternative faces a catch-22: H5N1 kills the very poultry used for egg-based vaccine production.

The US formally exited the WHO on January 22, 2026, terminating approximately $681 million in annual contributions. The administration subsequently proposed spending $2 billion per year to duplicate global disease surveillance systems previously accessed through WHO membership at a fraction of the cost. USAID was effectively shut down by DOGE, devastating US contributions to CEPI and global epidemic preparedness partnerships. CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System—covering 1,539 sites and 47% of the US population—narrowly survived a funding cliff when FY2026 appropriations transitioned it toward permanent status.

**Intervention points:** Reverse the BARDA mRNA wind-down immediately—this is the single most consequential biosecurity decision of 2025. Expand the H5N1 vaccine stockpile beyond 5 million courses using multiple platform technologies. Stabilize the vaccine market through regulatory predictability and guaranteed purchase commitments. Re-engage with WHO or establish equivalent multilateral surveillance capacity. Implement Apollo Program for Biodefense recommendations with multi-year appropriations. Pass the Biosecurity Modernization and Innovation Act for DNA synthesis screening.

## 9. Space governance is fragmented across six agencies while orbital debris approaches a tipping point

Approximately **40,000 objects** are tracked in orbit, with an estimated 1.2 million objects larger than 1 cm capable of causing catastrophic damage. Major fragmentation events in 2024 added at least 3,000 new tracked objects in a single year. ESA's 2025 Space Environment Report warns that at ~550 km altitude—the prime mega-constellation zone—debris objects now match the number of active satellites. Some scientists believe **early stages of the Kessler syndrome (runaway debris cascade) may already be underway**.

The regulatory architecture is profoundly inadequate. FCC's only debris enforcement action—a $150,000 fine against DISH Network—is trivially small. Only **300 of more than 10,000 active satellites carry insurance**; SpaceX's entire Starlink constellation (6,000+ satellites, approved for up to 42,000) is self-insured. FCC approved mega-constellations while insisting they are exempt from NEPA environmental review, despite a 2022 GAO recommendation to revisit this policy. No international or US regulatory framework specifically authorizes or governs active debris removal operations.

The Office of Space Commerce's Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS)—intended to assume civilian space traffic coordination from DOD—had **40% of its FY2025 budget rescinded** by the Commerce Department, and the administration proposed canceling it entirely in FY2026. The system remains in beta testing with only 17 pilot users as of February 2026, far from the operational capability envisioned under Space Policy Directive-3. The December 2025 executive order removing language about providing SSA data "free of direct user fees" signals a shift that could fragment the global space safety information architecture.

Meanwhile, Russia is developing a nuclear anti-satellite weapon capable of indiscriminately destroying thousands of satellites via electromagnetic pulse, and vetoed a US/Japan UN Security Council resolution against deploying nuclear weapons in space. Active debris removal technology is nearly ready—Astroscale demonstrated rendezvous with a defunct rocket stage in 2024, and multiple capture missions are planned for 2026—but there is no governance structure for who can remove what, no funding mechanism, and no liability framework.

**Intervention points:** Establish a unified civil space traffic management authority with binding regulatory power. Fund and operationalize TraCSS—the 40% budget rescission directly undermines America's civil STM capacity. Mandate orbital insurance or financial assurance for all licensed satellites. Close the mega-constellation environmental review exemption. Create an ADR regulatory and funding framework targeting removal of approximately 60 large objects per year (the modeled threshold for negative debris growth). Preserve free basic SSA data provision.

---

## 10. The science-policy trust crisis is self-reinforcing and accelerating institutional damage

In the first six months of the Trump administration, **51 of approximately 200 active federal science advisory committees were shut down**. EPA's Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee were dismissed in January 2025 with no replacements named nine months later—an unprecedented vacancy. NSF disbanded all 12 non-statutory advisory committees. DOE terminated six Office of Science advisory committees. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was restructured with vaccine-skeptic appointees who voted to remove combined MMRV vaccine recommendations for young children.

Public trust data reveals a nation split along partisan lines that make evidence-based policymaking nearly impossible. KFF polling shows CDC trust among Republicans at **39%** (down from 48%), while Democrats trust CDC at 85%. FDA trust fell 12 points overall to 53%. Republicans trust RFK Jr. (81%), Dr. Oz (83%), and Trump (84%) as much as their own doctors (84%) for health recommendations. The consequences are tangible: 2,280 measles cases in 2025 (worst in 30+ years), with 95% of those in the South Carolina outbreak unvaccinated.

The "Gold Standard Science" executive order (May 23, 2025) uses the language of transparency and reproducibility to install political appointees over scientific integrity oversight—the opposite of independent science protection. Agencies were directed to revert to 2021 policies and rescind Biden-era scientific integrity protections. NIH's scientific integrity policy was formally repealed. Federal scientists are leaving in droves not primarily because of forced layoffs but because of voluntary departures: at CDC, only 16% of 519 STEM PhD departures were forced. The majority quit or retired rather than participate in a politicized government.

Congressional science capacity remains crippled three decades after defunding the Office of Technology Assessment. GAO's Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics team has grown to approximately 100 staff but shares resources with auditing functions. Lobbyists remain the dominant source of science advice to Congress, with inherent conflicts of interest, at precisely the moment when congressional oversight of executive branch science policy is most needed.

**Intervention points:** Pass the Scientific Integrity Act to codify protections in law, insulating them from executive revocation. Fund OTA revival or equivalent to rebuild congressional science capacity. Build parallel independent advisory infrastructure outside government (Union of Concerned Scientists model) to ensure science advice remains available. Strengthen whistleblower protections for federal scientists through legislation. Address the partisan trust gap through community-level engagement rather than top-down messaging.

## The compounding nature of these bottlenecks demands integrated response

These ten bottlenecks are not independent—they form a reinforcing system of institutional decay. Civil service erosion (bottleneck 5) destroys the workforce needed for interagency coordination (1), which prevents effective data sharing (3), which undermines evidence-based permitting (2), which blocks the clean energy and mineral projects needed for planetary security (7). Funding fragmentation (4) prevents long-term investment in biosecurity (8) and space governance (9), while the trust crisis (10) makes public support for any of these investments politically impossible, which drives further AI governance paralysis (6).

The most critical near-term interventions, ranked by urgency and impact, are:

- **Reverse the BARDA mRNA wind-down** before the next pandemic pathogen emerges—H5N1 has already demonstrated preparedness gaps that could cost millions of lives
- **Give the AI Safety Institute statutory authority and funding** proportional to the $109 billion private investment in AI capabilities—the current $10 million budget is a rounding error
- **Establish multi-year appropriations** for climate, biosecurity, and space debris programs to break the annual CR cycle that makes long-term planetary investment structurally impossible
- **Fund and operationalize TraCSS** before a catastrophic orbital collision makes the Kessler syndrome irreversible
- **Pass the Scientific Integrity Act** and restore advisory committee capacity to rebuild the evidence-policy interface

The policy frameworks exist. GAO has issued hundreds of unimplemented recommendations. Think tanks across the political spectrum—CSIS on critical minerals, Carnegie on nuclear risk, RAND on biosecurity, CNAS on AI, Secure World Foundation on space debris—have published detailed, actionable roadmaps. The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense's Apollo Program, the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology's recommendations, and the National Academies' repeated warnings all point toward the same conclusion: the bottleneck is not knowledge but institutional will to act at the speed and scale the threats demand.
