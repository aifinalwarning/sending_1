Shared Bottlenecks Between Musk-Company Execution and Trump-Era Federal Policy Vectors for Planetary Benevolence and Planetary Security
Executive summary
As of February 25, 2026, Donald Trump is the sitting U.S. President (not only a former President), evidenced by contemporaneous White House presidential actions/fact sheets and reporting tied to his 2026 State of the Union. 
 This matters because (a) federal executive actions after January 2025 are directly part of the “latest available” policy surface and (b) many of those actions explicitly target the same “industrial chokepoints” that the Musk-linked company portfolio confronts: space launch cadence and licensing, satellite governance, AI compute buildout, energy infrastructure, and critical-mineral supply chains. 

Using “planetary benevolence” as a wellbeing-within-planetary-boundaries objective and “planetary security” as a catastrophic-risk and human-security objective, the most consequential shared bottlenecks cluster into six patterns:

First, energy and compute constraints are becoming a binding limit for AI scaling and electrification. xAI publicly describes Colossus as built rapidly and expanded to “200k GPUs,” while the IEA projects data-centre electricity demand to roughly double by 2030 in its base case; Trump’s second-term AI and permitting orders aim to accelerate AI data centers while simultaneously acknowledging grid strain (including rhetoric/initiatives pushing large tech firms toward self-supply). 

Second, permitting and environmental-review throughput is a persistent cross-sector choke (launch sites, data centers, mines, transmission lines, tunnels). Federal actions include both long-standing streamlining efforts (e.g., infrastructure permitting EO 13807) and 2025–2026 moves reshaping NEPA administration and emphasizing expedited permitting for AI infrastructure. Yet these same moves intensify litigation risk and legitimacy deficits, which can delay projects and undermine “benevolence” legitimacy. 

Third, space-domain sustainability and licensing is a shared bottleneck: orbital debris, space traffic management, spectrum coordination, and space-system cybersecurity. Federal policy has explicit STM and space cybersecurity directives (SPD-3, SPD-5), and FCC orbital-debris rules now include a five-year post-mission disposal expectation for many LEO systems. SpaceX’s Starship cadence and Starlink expansion remain tightly coupled to FAA and FCC processes, with frequent public scrutiny. 

Fourth, critical minerals and industrial base fragility (lithium, nickel, cobalt, rare earths, semiconductors) is simultaneously a climate-transition bottleneck and a national-security bottleneck. Policy responses include (i) critical-minerals executive actions dating to the first Trump term and (ii) second-term initiatives tying trade tools (tariffs) and even AI-enabled pricing concepts to reshoring and resilience, while corporate disclosures show continued supply-chain de-risking (e.g., a Tesla in-house lithium refinery starting operations in early 2026). 

Fifth, governance and accountability under high private leverage is a bottleneck for both benevolence and security: the more government functions depend on privately controlled launch/satellite/AI infrastructure, the more acute are conflict-of-interest, transparency, continuity-of-service, and democratic oversight concerns. These become national-security problems when systems are used in conflict contexts or critical infrastructure. 

Sixth, social trust, epistemic stability, and polarization constrain adoption and stable policy coalitions. The World Economic Forum consistently ranks misinformation/disinformation and societal polarization among top near-term risks, and U.S. policy debates over “bias,” “misinformation,” and climate governance are visible in AI and environmental rule changes. For benevolence goals that require durable cooperation (climate mitigation, equitable infrastructure, global coordination), trust deficits become a “soft bottleneck” that behaves like a hard one because it increases delay, litigation, and reversal risk. 

Mitigations that appear consistently high-leverage across bottlenecks include: “build-to-audit” technical architectures (verifiable safety cases; telemetry; third-party red-teaming), “permit-to-standard” governance (predictable timelines tied to measurable environmental and safety performance), multi-stakeholder “space commons” coordination (STM + debris + spectrum data sharing), and “industrial resilience compacts” (critical-mineral standards, recycling, diversified sourcing, and alliance-based procurement). 

Definitions, scope, and assumptions
Definitions used in this report
Planetary benevolence (working definition): the sustained improvement of human wellbeing and capability while maintaining Earth-system stability and minimizing irreversible harms, grounded in the “safe operating space for humanity” concept (planetary boundaries) and the “planetary health” framing that links the health of civilization to the state of natural systems. 

Operationally, this definition treats the following as “benevolence-relevant” outcomes: rapid decarbonization and pollution reduction, resilient infrastructure, broad access to connectivity, reduced accident/injury burdens, improved health capabilities, and governance that is transparent and rights-respecting. 

Planetary security (working definition): reduction of the probability and severity of global catastrophic harms to human survival, freedom, and long-run potential, combining (a) the UNDP notion of “human security” centered on people and livelihoods and (b) existential / global-catastrophic risk frameworks concerned with civilization-scale failure modes. 

Operationally, this includes cyber/space infrastructure resilience, conflict escalation control, deterrence stability, biosecurity and public-health capability, and management of advanced-technology risks (notably AI). 

Scope
Timeframe: “latest available up to 2026-02-25” as requested, emphasizing 2017–2026 because it spans the first Trump term, the 2024 campaign platform era, and the second Trump term’s executive actions and rulemakings. 

Geography: primarily U.S. federal policy vectors and globally coupled impacts (e.g., satellite governance via ITU coordination, global supply chains, and emissions-driven Earth-system impacts). 

Entities in scope (non-exhaustive) include U.S. executive actions, federal rulemakings, agency guidance, and public statements; plus company mission statements, filings, and major programmatic constraints that create “bottleneck pressure.” 

Assumptions and “unspecified” handling
Some items are unspecified by the request (e.g., the precise ethical weightings between climate mitigation vs. national defense; or whether “planetary security” privileges U.S. security vs. global stability). Those are treated as unspecified; this report therefore evaluates bottlenecks under two lenses simultaneously: (1) Earth-system / wellbeing outcomes and (2) catastrophic-risk / strategic stability outcomes. 

Policy initiatives that have been announced but lack detailed implementing text (e.g., public claims about tech firms building power plants) are treated as directional signals rather than settled law, and are cited as such. 

Key institutional actors frequently referenced include: NASA, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Communications Commission, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Council on Environmental Quality, National Institute of Standards and Technology, International Energy Agency, International Telecommunication Union, United Nations Development Programme, and World Economic Forum. 

Methodology and prioritized sources
Method
The analysis follows a “two-sided bottleneck mapping” procedure:

Capability vectors: Extract each company’s stated mission and major operational dependencies (e.g., permits, spectrum access, compute, critical inputs). 
Policy vectors: Identify federal initiatives that directly shape those dependencies (executive orders, agency rulemakings, official guidance, tariffs, and major public statements). 
Bottleneck taxonomy: Classify shared bottlenecks into seven domains requested: technological; regulatory/legal; economic/finance; supply chain/materials; governance/coordination; social/ethical/public acceptance; security/risk.
Impact scoring (qualitative): For each bottleneck, assess likely effect direction on (a) benevolence outcomes and (b) security outcomes, noting where these diverge. 
Mitigation option design: Propose interventions in three classes—technical, policy, governance—with attention to feasibility and reversibility.
Source hierarchy used
Priority order (highest to lowest), aligned to the request:

Primary/official government sources: White House presidential actions and fact sheets; agency rulemakings and guidance; Federal Register notices; agency program pages. 
Primary/official company sources: mission pages; sustainability/impact pages; SEC filings; official program updates. 
Original academic / synthesis research: planetary boundaries; planetary health; IPCC summaries; NASA debris guidance; peer-reviewed studies on satellite impacts. 
Reputable policy think tanks and standards bodies: RAND global catastrophic risk assessment; NIST AI RMF; SWP analysis where relevant. 
Mainstream press for statements / contemporaneous events: Reuters/AP/major outlets for real-time developments and quotations, used as secondary corroboration around official texts. 
Landscape of mission vectors and policy vectors
Company mission vectors and their “planetary” relevance
Across the Musk-linked portfolio, the stated missions map to two planetary goals:

Benevolence-facing missions include sustainable energy transition and potentially beneficial health/assistive neurotechnology, reflected in Tesla’s mission to accelerate sustainable energy and Neuralink’s focus on restoring autonomy for unmet medical needs. 

Security-facing missions include resilient connectivity and strategic advantage through AI/space capabilities: Starlink markets global, resilient connectivity; xAI frames its work as advancing comprehension and capabilities (“Understand the Universe”) while building massive compute infrastructure (Colossus). 

SpaceX’s mission framing—reducing the cost of space access via rapid full reusability—connects to long-horizon “species-level resilience” narratives (multi-planet capability) and near-horizon civil and defense space infrastructure. 

Trump-era policy vectors most relevant to shared bottlenecks
From 2017–2020, salient vectors include: commercial space regulatory streamlining (SPD-2), space traffic management (SPD-3), establishing a Space Force path (SPD-4), and space cybersecurity principles (SPD-5). 

From 2025–2026 (second term), salient vectors include:

AI acceleration and preemption direction: executive actions to remove barriers to AI leadership, establish national AI policy frameworks, and launch the “Genesis Mission” to accelerate AI-enabled scientific discovery—explicitly tied to national/economic security and industrial dominance in official language. 
AI-infrastructure permitting: executive order explicitly prioritizing rapid buildout of AI data centers and related transmission/energy infrastructure by easing federal regulatory burdens. 
Space acceleration and security posture: “Ensuring American Space Superiority” (Dec 2025) sets an Artemis Moon-by-2028 goal in official text, and separate orders target commercial space competition and missile defense. 
Energy dominance + NEPA restructuring: executive action language directing rescission of CEQ NEPA regulations and broad “unleashing energy” positioning; contemporaneous agency pages describe removal/changes to CEQ NEPA regulations in response. 
Climate-regulatory reversal: EPA final action rescinding the greenhouse-gas endangerment finding (effective April 20, 2026) and linking the change to motor-vehicle GHG regulatory authority. 
Tariff-centric industrial policy: fact sheets and proclamations describe broad tariffs, automotive import tariffs, and a temporary import duty with numerous carve-outs (including vehicles, aerospace products, some electronics, and certain critical minerals).

Technological bottlenecks
Bottleneck: Validation of high-consequence autonomy and closed-loop systems
Evidence and examples (company side):
The company portfolio includes multiple technology classes where failures can propagate broadly: satellite networks at global scale (e.g., rare Starlink outage tied to internal software service failure), and implanted neurotechnology scaling from trials into broader use. 

Evidence and examples (policy side):
Federal policy signals a dual desire: accelerate deployment (AI leadership and infrastructure EOs) while relying on standards and safety frameworks that remain voluntary or sector-specific (e.g., NIST AI RMF positioned as voluntary guidance for managing AI risks). 

Impact on planetary benevolence/security:
For benevolence, weak validation can cause harms (accidents, medical harms, infrastructure failures) that erode trust and slow diffusion of beneficial tech. For security, brittle autonomy increases attack surfaces and escalation risk, especially when systems become defense-relevant. 

Mitigation options:
Technical: safety cases with measurable hazard analyses; “failure containment” architectures; mandatory incident reporting for critical services; red-team requirements for safety-critical updates. 

Policy: expand sectoral safety baselines where voluntary frameworks are insufficient (e.g., requiring independent audits for critical AI used in infrastructure). 

Governance: licensing contingent on demonstrated operational resilience (e.g., satellite network continuity SLAs for defense use; medical-device cybersecurity requirements). 

Bottleneck: Energy-system and grid capacity as a scaling ceiling for AI and electrification
Evidence and examples (company side):
xAI’s own materials describe rapid buildout and scaling of a massive training system (Colossus), which implies major energy demand; Tesla filings also highlight ongoing industrial scale-up and supply-chain vertical integration, and the electrification ecosystem depends on a reliable grid. 

Evidence and examples (policy side):
Federal actions simultaneously push AI infrastructure and emphasize energy dominance and reliability. The AI data-center permitting EO explicitly calls for easing regulatory burdens to build data centers and high-voltage transmission; reportage ties the AI boom to grid constraints and describes Trump pushing self-supply by tech firms. 

Impact on planetary benevolence/security:
Benevolence: if incremental power comes from high-emissions sources and weak environmental controls, it conflicts with planetary-boundary goals. 

Security: grid scarcity and congestion can produce strategic vulnerability, especially if both civil life and defense-relevant compute depend on constrained nodes. 

Mitigation options:
Technical: co-locate data centers with low-carbon firm generation; demand response; waste-heat reuse; hardware efficiency and model efficiency targets as first-class KPIs. 

Policy: require grid-impact disclosures and mitigation plans for “GW-scale” data center projects; accelerate interconnection processes without eliminating environmental safeguards. 

Governance: treat compute and data-center energy as critical infrastructure with resilience standards (N-1, cyber baselines). 

Regulatory and legal bottlenecks
Bottleneck: Launch, spectrum, and environmental licensing throughput (with compounding externalities)
Evidence and examples (company side):
Starship cadence and licensing are explicitly mediated through FAA environmental assessments and safety processes, including tiered EAs, public comment, and mishap/return-to-flight determinations. 

Evidence and examples (policy side):
This bottleneck is the target of policy: (a) earlier directives (SPD-2) to streamline commercial space regulation, and (b) the 2025 EO on enabling competition in commercial space, supported by a fact sheet emphasizing streamlined regulations. 

Impact on planetary benevolence/security:
Benevolence: accelerated launches and constellations can support Earth observation and connectivity but also intensify debris, astronomy impacts, and atmospheric externalities if not governed. 

Security: faster launch and satellite build can strengthen resilience and deterrence, but poor process can create systemic hazards (accidents, debris cascades) that degrade strategic stability. 

Mitigation options:
Technical: design-for-disposal satellites; collision-avoidance transparency; robust launch safety analyses and debris containment. 

Policy: predictable licensing SLAs coupled to enforceable sustainability constraints (deorbit metrics, debris liabilities). 

Governance: independent reporting and shared STM data infrastructures to reduce informational asymmetry. 

Bottleneck: Federal climate regulatory reversals and the “authority baseline” for emissions regulation
Evidence and examples (policy side):
EPA states that rescinding the 2009 greenhouse-gas endangerment finding removes the Clean Air Act Section 202(a) basis for prescribing vehicle GHG standards, and the Federal Register final action explicitly rescinds the finding and repeals vehicle GHG standards for multiple classes. 

Evidence and examples (company side):
Tesla’s business and mission are explicitly tied to accelerating sustainable energy; in a world where federal emissions standards are removed, policy-driven demand signals become more state-driven and globally fragmented, increasing uncertainty. 

Impact on planetary benevolence/security:
Benevolence: climate mitigation is a central planetary-boundary stabilizer; IPCC emphasizes steep emissions reductions for 1.5°C-consistent pathways, so reductions in regulatory capacity raise long-run benevolence risk. 

Security: climate change is treated in catastrophic-risk assessments as a global catastrophe contributor; weakening mitigation can increase long-range destabilization channels (resource stress, disasters). 

Mitigation options:
Policy: replace unstable authority fights with durable, technology-neutral performance standards enacted through legislation where feasible; maintain transparent cost–benefit and health-impact accounting. 

Governance: build state–federal compacts or multi-level governance mechanisms to reduce oscillation risk; explicitly track reversal risk in investment decisions. 

Economic and finance bottlenecks
Bottleneck: Capital intensity under policy volatility (tariffs, procurement, budget shifts)
Evidence and examples (policy side):
Second-term tariff policy is described as a lever for national security and reshoring (e.g., 25% tariffs on imported autos/parts under Section 232; broad tariffs under IEEPA; temporary 10% import duty under Section 122 with carve-outs for vehicles, aerospace, certain electronics, and some critical minerals). 

Evidence and examples (company side):
Large-scale manufacturing and space programs are capital intensive and sensitive to input costs; Tesla disclosures stress de-risking supply chains and note vertical integration moves like its Texas lithium refinery commencing operations in early 2026. 

Impact on planetary benevolence/security:
Benevolence: tariffs can strengthen domestic supply resilience but raise costs for clean-energy and electrification deployment if inputs become more expensive or constrained. 

Security: economic confrontation is increasingly framed as a top global risk; policy volatility can raise escalation risk and weaken alliance coordination. 

Mitigation options:
Policy: implement resilience mechanisms that are predictable and targeted (e.g., time-bound incentives for recycling and domestic refining) rather than broad shocks that propagate cost inflation. 

Governance: mandatory “tariff exposure disclosure” for critical infrastructure providers and defense-relevant services, plus contingency procurement planning. 

Bottleneck: Government reliance on private capability with under-specified long-term funding stability
Evidence and examples:
NASA’s Artemis-specific reliance on private contractors is visible in NASA award actions (e.g., Starship HLS contract modifications), while Trump’s “Moon by 2028” executive order sets ambitious timelines that hinge on contractor readiness. 

Impact:
Benevolence: science and exploration can yield societal returns, but funding whiplash or workforce disruption undermines capability and trust. 

Security: dependence concentrations create single points of failure and raise continuity-of-operations concerns. 

Mitigations:
Policy/governance: diversify providers for critical lanes; require “continuity plans” and fallback architectures; publish clear milestone-based funding commitments. 

Supply chains and materials bottlenecks
Bottleneck: Critical mineral concentration and price instability
Evidence and examples (research):
The IEA tracks demand/supply outlooks for critical minerals and notes tightness risks in key inputs; concentration and geopolitical exposure remain central. 

Evidence and examples (policy side):
EO 13817 frames critical minerals as a strategic vulnerability and directs federal action to reduce supply disruption vulnerability. 

Second-term initiatives described in reporting include using Pentagon-developed AI tools to create reference prices for critical minerals, indicating policy interest in reshaping market structure. 

Evidence and examples (company side):
Tesla’s filings emphasize supply-chain de-risking and vertical integration (including an in-house lithium refinery). 

Impact on planetary benevolence/security:
Benevolence: mineral bottlenecks slow electrification and energy transition, undermining emissions reduction pathways. 

Security: concentrated supply chains can be leveraged coercively; attempts to counter-concentrate can intensify economic confrontation. 

Mitigation options:
Technical: design for lower-criticality chemistries and higher recycling; expand secondary supply and materials substitution. 

Policy: diversify supply via allied sourcing and transparent environmental/social standards to avoid “security fixes” that increase local harm. 

Governance: create “critical minerals provenance” metadata requirements for federal procurement and defense supply chains. 

Bottleneck: Semiconductor and networking industrial base (AI + space)
Evidence and examples:
AI policy documents and priorities emphasize advanced semiconductors and AI infrastructure; xAI’s compute build and broader AI boom reporting show enormous capital and hardware requirements. 

Impact:
Benevolence/security both face “hardware gating”: compute scarcity can slow both beneficial discovery and defensive readiness, while export controls can reshape geopolitics. 

Mitigation:
Policy: long-horizon industrial base strategies that are stable across administrations; encourage modularity and resilience (multi-vendor). 

Governance and coordination bottlenecks
Bottleneck: Space governance fragmentation (STM, spectrum coordination, and multi-actor externalities)
Evidence and examples:
Space traffic management policy exists (SPD-3) but operational coordination remains multi-actor; satellite filings require international coordination (ITU), and U.S. regulators explicitly describe international satellite coordination as ITU registration processes. 

Orbital debris rules now embed a five-year disposal expectation for LEO systems with uncontrolled reentry disposal pathways. 

Company-side pressure:
Mega-constellations scale the externalities; peer-reviewed research indicates large satellite constellations can contaminate space-telescope images, demonstrating system-level impacts. 

Impact:
Benevolence: degraded space commons harms Earth observation, science, and connectivity. 

Security: congestion increases vulnerability of national-security space assets and raises collision/attribution complexity. 

Mitigation options:
Governance: create interoperable STM data standards; mandate conjunction reporting; align domestic rules with ITU processes and transparent cross-border coordination channels. 

Technical: brightness mitigation and transparency for astronomy impacts; design satellites for lower reflectivity (acknowledging that this remains contested and evolving). 

Bottleneck: Public-private dependency and conflict-of-interest governance
Evidence and examples:
Defense and national security contracting with private launch/satellite providers is documented in reporting and in Space Force award announcements; NASA leadership appointments have drawn conflict-of-interest questions due to contractor relationships in mainstream reporting. 

Impact:
Benevolence: perceived capture reduces legitimacy for major infrastructure decisions. 

Security: concentrated reliance creates high-value targets and continuity risks. 

Mitigations:
Governance: strict conflict-of-interest firewalls; independent procurement audits; continuity-of-service requirements for critical services; contingency planning that assumes provider failure. 

Social, ethical, and public-acceptance bottlenecks
Bottleneck: Polarization and misinformation degrade coalition stability
Evidence and examples:
WEF risk outlook emphasizes misinformation/disinformation and societal polarization as major near-term risks. 

Local opposition delays data centers due to perceived harms (energy costs, water use, noise), showing how social consent becomes an operational constraint. 

Policy-side relevance:
AI executive actions emphasize removing barriers and framing “bias” concerns as central, indicating that legitimacy debates are part of the policy surface affecting AI governance. 

Impact:
Benevolence: decarbonization and public-health resilience require broad, durable buy-in; polarization raises reversal odds and slows deployment. 

Security: polarization increases vulnerability to information operations and complicates crisis decision-making. 

Mitigations:
Governance: radical transparency on externalities (grid impacts, emissions, debris risk); participatory planning for high-impact infrastructure; third-party measurement and open dashboards. 

Bottleneck: Biomedical ethics and safety legitimacy for implanted neurotechnology
Evidence and examples (company side):
Neuralink’s PRIME Study recruitment notes the study is conducted under an FDA investigational device exemption (IDE), indicating high regulatory scrutiny and staged deployment. 

Evidence and examples (policy side):
FDA guidance for implanted BCI devices outlines nonclinical and clinical considerations for IDE feasibility and pivotal studies, showing the complexity of safety validation. 

Trump’s first-term “Right to Try” positioning and signing statements emphasize accelerated access and consumer “choice,” reflecting a deregulatory ethos that can create tension with long-horizon safety legitimacy. 

Impact:
Benevolence: neurotech can restore autonomy, but premature scale-up failures would create long-lasting trust damage. 

Security: device cybersecurity and dual-use concerns (surveillance, coercion narratives) increase geopolitical and ethical risk. 

Mitigations:
Technical: strong post-market surveillance plans; security-by-design; transparent adverse event reporting. 

Governance: independent ethics review boards with public reporting; explicit consent and control rights frameworks, plus legal protections against coercive uses. 

Security and risk bottlenecks
Bottleneck: Cybersecurity of space systems and critical networks
Evidence and examples:
SPD-5 explicitly frames protection of space systems from cyber incidents as essential to prevent disruptions to critical infrastructure contributions, and CISA describes SPD-5 as establishing key cybersecurity principles for space systems. 

Starlink’s rare global outage tied to internal software services illustrates that even non-malicious failures can produce defense-relevant continuity concerns. 

Impact:
Benevolence: connectivity failures harm disaster response and critical services; security incidents erode trust. 

Security: space and network infrastructure are strategic assets; cyber fragility enables coercion or escalatory misattribution. 

Mitigations:
Technical: defense-in-depth; rigorous change-management for core network services; offline failover modes and graceful degradation. 

Policy/governance: incident reporting requirements for critical communications systems; harmonize space cyber standards with broader cybersecurity frameworks. 

Bottleneck: Space militarization and escalation dynamics
Evidence and examples:
Trump’s missile-defense orders frame advanced missile threats as catastrophic and emphasize building a homeland missile-defense shield; broader reporting and analysis describe the “Golden Dome” concept and associated destabilization concerns. 

Trump’s “space superiority” EO explicitly includes security and prosperity framing and commits to assertive space leadership. 

Company-side coupling:
When commercial constellations become defense-relevant, they can become perceived military targets, increasing geopolitical risk (an issue frequently raised in policy and strategic analysis of dual-use space mega-constellations). 

Impact:
Benevolence: militarization risks crowd out cooperative space governance and science. 

Security: may enhance deterrence in some models, but also raises arms-race and crisis-instability pathways (especially with space-based interceptors). 

Mitigations:
Governance: confidence-building measures, transparency on space-based defense architectures, and explicit norms for debris-creating tests; strengthen STM as “risk-reduction infrastructure.”

License recommendation
Dual-license approach:

Code: MIT License (permissive, widely compatible for web tooling).
Content (research narrative, original diagrams, summaries): Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0) to enable reuse with attribution.
This mirrors common open research repos’ pattern: permissive code + attribution-required content. (Implementation should include clear separation in LICENSE files.)
Contribution guidelines (high-signal minimum)
md
Copy
## Contribution Principles
- Evidence-first: every non-trivial claim must cite a primary source OR a reputable synthesis (IPCC/IEA/NIST/RAND).
- Quote limits: keep direct quotes short; prefer paraphrase with citation.
- Neutral tone: describe policy and corporate actions; separate facts from interpretation.
- Safety: do not include instructions that enable wrongdoing (cyberattack, sabotage, coercion).

## Required for PRs
- Add or update a bottleneck JSON in docs/data/bottlenecks/
- Add sources in docs/data/sources/ (URL + date accessed)
- Update docs/diagrams/ if relationships change
- Run tools/scripts/validate.js (CI enforces)

A build script can transform the JSON files into cards and render Mermaid diagrams client-side or during a static build step.

“Extra-superficial meta-prompt chains” for contributors
These are intentionally designed as repeatable, low-ambiguity prompts for expanding the repo.

Chain A: Add a policy-to-bottleneck evidence record

Source capture
“Find the primary text for [policy name] and extract: date, authority, key operative sections, and implementation agencies. Output as JSON with fields: title, date, authority, summary, agencies, links.”

Bottleneck mapping
“Given this policy JSON and the bottleneck taxonomy, map which bottleneck IDs it touches and why. Output: list of {bottleneck_id, mechanism, expected effect, confidence}.”

Quality gate
“Check for: (a) at least one primary source link, (b) no uncited claims, (c) neutral language. If any fail, rewrite.”

Chain B: Add a company constraint record

“From the latest annual report / primary mission page for [company], extract explicit constraints or dependencies (permits, materials, compute, regulators). Provide citations as URLs.”
“Convert each constraint into a bottleneck linkage: {constraint → domain → bottleneck_id → short rationale}.”
“Propose one technical mitigation and one governance mitigation; label as speculative unless sourced.”
Chain C: Maintain the timeline

“For the date range [YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD], list all new executive orders / final rules relevant to: AI, space, NEPA/permitting, critical minerals, climate regulation.”
“Update timeline.mmd with only items that (a) directly change a bottleneck pressure or (b) materially change implementation pathways.”
“Add citations in data/sources and link each timeline node to a source record.”
Next steps for implementers and maintainers
Establish a “2026-02-25 baseline snapshot” by freezing all primary sources already cited here (White House presidential actions, EPA final rule pages, FAA environmental assessment notices, IEA energy/EV reports, and UNDP/planetary boundaries references) into the repository’s docs/data/sources/ index so future updates can be diffed. 

Prioritize three MVP bottleneck pages—(1) energy & compute, (2) permitting throughput, (3) orbital debris/space governance—because these recur across nearly every domain and are explicitly shaped by 2025–2026 executive actions and rules. 

Create an evidence QA policy that forces each bottleneck entry to include at least one primary source and one independent synthesis source (e.g., IEA, IPCC, RAND, NIST) to prevent the repo from drifting into opinionated narrative.
